# Original Code
```python
def is_palindrone(s):
    r=""
    for c in s:
        r = c +r
    for x in range(0, len(s)):
        if s[x] == r[x]:
            x = True
        else:
            return False
    return x
```

##  Typo
The function should be named `is_palindrome`, since the `n` is a typo.


## Style
`c +r` should be written as `c + r` to conform with [PEP8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#other-recommendations)


## Reversing a String
The first few lines build up a reversed string. `c + r` makes this an O(n^2) operation because strings are immutable, and we are building a new string every time. Let's use `s[::-1]` to reverse a string, as it's faster and easier to read. We can assign it to `reversed_string`, which is a more descriptive variable name if one isn't sure what [::-1] does.

The first two lines now look like:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    reversed_string = s[::-1]
```

## String Comparison
We don't need to iterate character by character to determine whether or not we return `True` or `False`. We can compare strings directly by saying `return reversed_string == s`.


The original code also uses `x` as both an iteration variable, and our boolean result. It's being set to `True`, but each iteration of the loop sets it back to `1, 2, 3, etc`. At the end it finally returns True if it's a palindrome because `x` exists in the scope. However, on an empty string, `x` is not found so you'll get an `UnboundLocalError`.


## Type / Docstrings
Let's add type annotations to be clear to the reader, and to enforce correctness with a linter. For older versions of Python, docstrings work as well.

Our code now looks like:

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    reversed_string = s[::-1]
    return reversed_string == s
```

We can improve the runtime with a different approach, but this should be acceptable (and easier to read) for most situations.

## Robustness
The function isn't very robust. Should we consider case sensitivity and non-alpha characters? We can add these as optional parameters if the caller wishes to use it.

# Final Code
```python
def is_palindrome(s: str, case_insensitive: bool = False, only_alpha: bool = False) -> bool:
    """
    Determines whether or not a string is a palindrome.

    s: Input string
    case_insensitive: When True, considers uppercase and lowercase letters as the same.
    only_alpha: When True, considers only alphabetic characters
                https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha

    returns: Boolean denoting if the input is a palindrome.
    """
    if case_insensitive:
        s = s.lower()
    if only_alpha:
        s = ''.join(filter(str.isalpha, s))

    reversed_string = s[::-1]
    return reversed_string == s
```
